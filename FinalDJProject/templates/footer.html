    <p style = "margin-top:20px" >Some of the takeaways from this project include the following:<br>
      1) Brooklyn and Queens had the highest number of hospitalizations <br>
      during the peaks of the pandemic. This was unsurprising because it reflected their
      larger populations. <br>
      
      2) The Bronx had the highest hospitalizations per capita.<br>
      
      3) Staten Island had the lowest number of hospitalizations largely due <br>
      its proportionally small population.
